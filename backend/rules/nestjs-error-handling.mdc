Use NestJS HttpException (or subclasses) for all user-facing errors.
Never throw generic Error from controllers.
Business logic errors should be mapped to HTTP errors at the boundary.
Do not leak internal errors or stack traces to the client.
Use global exception filters for cross-cutting concerns only.
