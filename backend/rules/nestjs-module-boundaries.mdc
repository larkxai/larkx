Every feature must live in its own NestJS module.
Controllers handle HTTP only (routing, params, status codes).
Business logic must live in services, never in controllers.
Do not import services across modules directly:
Expose services via exports in the owning module.
Avoid “god modules”; if a module grows too large, split it.
