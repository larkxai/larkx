- Use shadcn/ui components first; do not reinvent base UI primitives (Button, Input, Dialog, Dropdown, Tabs, etc).
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Prefer className composition via `cn()` utility (if repo has it) instead of complex conditional logic inline.
- Keep components small and composable:
  - Container components handle data fetching + mutations.
  - Presentational components accept typed props and render UI only.
- Ensure all UI states exist:
  - loading, empty, error, success, disabled
- Forms must have:
  - validation errors shown near fields
  - disabled submit while pending
  - optimistic UI only if explicitly safe
